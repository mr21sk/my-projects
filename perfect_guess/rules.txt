Objective:

Your goal is to guess the number I have randomly chosen between 1 and 100.

Rules:

You have 3 attempts to guess the correct number.
After each guess, I will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.
If you guess correctly within 3 attempts, you win!
If you donott guess the number in 3 tries, I will reveal the correct number, and the game will end.

How to Play:

Step 1: Think of a number between 1 and 100 and tell me your first guess.
Step 2: I will give you feedback (too high, too low, or correct).
Step 3: Based on my feedback, adjust your guess and try again.
Step 4: Keep going until you either guess the number correctly or run out of attempts.

End of Game:

If you guess correctly, I will celebrate your win!
If you donot guess the number, I will reveal it and encourage you to try again.
